# 📊 CRM Donor SQL Project

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze donor engagement, donation patterns, and regional contributions from a simulated CRM dataset using SQL.

## 🧾 Executive Summary
This project focuses on analyzing donor engagement and contribution behavior using SQL in a simulated CRM (Customer Relationship Management) environment. The dataset, composed of donor demographic details, donation history, and engagement metrics, was imported and transformed using MySQL Workbench.

The project involved cleaning and structuring the data, creating relational tables, and performing in-depth analysis using SQL queries. Advanced SQL concepts such as JOINs, CASE statements, date conversions, aggregations, and subqueries were used to extract meaningful insights.

Key objectives included segmenting donors based on engagement levels, identifying high-value and lapsed donors, and evaluating region-wise donation trends. The project demonstrates the power of SQL in real-world CRM analytics, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to improve donor retention and engagement strategies.

## 🔍 Key Achievements:
Built a normalized schema by splitting the flat dataset into relational tables.

Segmented donors into "Highly Engaged", "Moderately Engaged", and "Low Engagement".

Identified top donors and those who hadn’t donated in over a year.

Analyzed state-level donation trends to support targeted outreach.

Applied SQL JOINs, filtering, grouping, and time-based logic.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Top 10 high-value donors
- Lapsed donor identification (no donations in the last 12 months)
- State-wise donation summary
- JOIN queries across donor info, donation history, and engagement
